    actor and producer. He is particularly known for his nine collaborations with filmmaker Martin Scorsese, and is the
    recipient of various accolades, including two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, the Cecil B. DeMille Award, and

    Born in Manhattan in New York City, De Niro studied acting at HB Studio, Stella Adler Conservatory, and Lee
    Strasberg's Actors Studio. His first major role was in Greetings (1968), and he gained early recognition with his
    role as a baseball player in the sports drama Bang the Drum Slowly (1973). De Niro's first collaboration with
    Scorsese was Mean Streets (1973), where he played small-time NYC crook "Johnny Boy". Stardom followed with his role
    as young Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's crime epic The Godfather Part II (1974), which won De Niro the
    Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. For his portrayal of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976) and a soldier in
    the Vietnam War drama The Deer Hunter (1978), he earned two nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

    De Niro won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of world middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta in
    Scorsese's biographical drama Raging Bull (1980), his first Oscar in this category. He soon thereafter diversified
    to other roles, playing a stand-up comic in The King of Comedy (1982), and gained further recognition for his
    performances in Bernardo Bertolucci's epic 1900 (1976), Sergio Leone's crime epic Once Upon a Time in America
    (1984), Terry Gilliam's dystopian satire Brazil (1985), the religious epic The Mission (1986), and the comedy
    Midnight Run (1988). De Niro portrayed gangster Jimmy Conway in Goodfellas (1990), a catatonic patient in the drama
    Awakenings (1990), and a criminal in the psychological thriller Cape Fear (1991). All three films received praise
    for De Niro's performances. He then starred in This Boy's Life (1993), and directed his first feature film with
    1993's A Bronx Tale. His other critical successes include the crime films Heat (1995) and Casino (1995).
